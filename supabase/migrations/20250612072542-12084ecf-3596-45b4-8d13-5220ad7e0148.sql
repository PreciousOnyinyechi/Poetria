('ext_001', 'The Road Not Taken', 'Robert Frost', 'Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever be back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.', 'classic', 'https://poets.org/poem/road-not-taken', true),

('ext_002', 'Still I Rise', 'Maya Angelou', 'You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I''ll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
''Cause I walk like I''ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I''ll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don''t you take it awful hard
''Cause I laugh like I''ve got gold mines
Diggin'' in my own backyard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I''ll rise.', 'modern', 'https://poets.org/poem/still-i-rise', true),

('ext_003', 'Hope is the thing with feathers', 'Emily Dickinson', '"Hope" is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

I''ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.', 'classic', 'https://poets.org/poem/hope-thing-feathers-254', true),

('ext_004', 'Invictus', 'William Ernest Henley', 'Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.', 'inspirational', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus', true),

('ext_005', 'Sonnet 18', 'William Shakespeare', 'Shall I compare thee to a summer''s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer''s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm''d;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature''s changing course untrimm''d;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow''st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander''st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow''st:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.', 'romantic', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45087/sonnet-18-shall-i-compare-thee-to-a-summers-day', true),

('ext_006', 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening', 'Robert Frost', 'Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound''s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.', 'nature', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening', true),

('ext_007', 'Dreams', 'Langston Hughes', 'Hold fast to dreams
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.', 'inspirational', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/150995/dreams-5d767850da976', true),

('ext_008', 'Fire and Ice', 'Robert Frost', 'Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I''ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.', 'modern', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice', true),

('ext_009', 'If—', 'Rudyard Kipling', 'If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don''t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don''t give way to hating,
    And yet don''t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you''ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ''em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ''Hold on!''

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds'' worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that''s in it,   
    And—which is more—you''ll be a Man, my son!', 'classic', 'https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---', true),

('ext_010', 'Do not go gentle into that good night', 'Dylan Thomas', 'Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.', 'classic', 'https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night', true);
